    <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
    <p>Hi My name is Sawan Choudhary, I am from Himachal Pradesh, and here I would like to put my view on culture and traditions of Himachal. The entire State is punctuated with stone as well as wood temples. The rich culture and traditions have made Himachal unique in itself. The shadowy valleys, rugged crags, glaciers and gigantic pines and roaring rivers and exquisite flora and fauna compose the symphony that is for ever Himachal. Himachal derives its origin from two Hindi words Him and Aanchal, meaning Snow and Lap respectively. Thus, etymologically, Himachal Pradesh stands for the region which lies in the slopes and foothills of the Himalayas. Hence Himachal literally means in the lap of snow-covered mountains. It was named by Acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma, one of the great Sanskrit scholars and astrologers of Himachal Pradesh.

    Most of the snow-draped peaks, hilltops, banks of lakes and rivers, or natural caves have been considered as sacred as the Adobe of Gods. It is also popularly known as “Dev Bhoomi” or Land of Gods.

    Shimla, the capital city of Himachal Pradesh, is the third smoke-free city in India. Shimla has served as the Capital of India during the British Raj, the capital of Punjab, and then the capital of Himachal.
